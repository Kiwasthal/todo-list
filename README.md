# todo-list

A todo-list with various features. Creating a project will allow you to assign various todo's, to keep track of your goals. There is also a feature displaying your tasks for the day.

This project is created with the intent of showcasing the ability to work with somewhat advanced objects and arrays . <a href="https://date-fns.org/">Date-fns</a> was installed as an npm package for easier manipulation of dates around the application's code . Local storage methods where also used allowing the user to store each sessions information.

Here is the <a href="https://kiwasthal.github.io/todo-list/"> project's demo </a>.

As a side note, the project was build with a purpose of incorporating some of the OOP principles, however , taking a look at the overall result , many compositional changes could be made to improve readability and code repetition. Some of the functionality is stored in modules compromising the sole responsibility principle , perhaps a future-build should incorporate added modules along the lines of SOLID stereotypes.
